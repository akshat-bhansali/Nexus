        more on Our Artisans) From hand-hemmed tips to hand-stitched shoulders,
        our artisans craft all 40 Colori garments and accessories according to
        the highest quality standards to create hard-wearing everyday pieces for
        a timeless casual elegance. To make this happen, we provide them with
        the canvas to turn into their next creation. We travel around Italy,
        visiting mills and merchants to find the best fabrics and yarns, making
        sure they are natural, colourful and responsibly sourced. (read more on
